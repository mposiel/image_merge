# ImageMerge program
This program allows users to merge smaller images into a larger image. The program takes user inputs for the destination image file name, the number of subimages to be merged, the name of each subimage, and the coordinates where each subimage should be placed in the destination image. The program then merges the subimages into the destination image and saves the resulting image as a new file.

## How to use it
For each subimage:

1. Enter the name of the subimage file.

2. Enter the coordinates where the subimage should be placed in the destination image.

The program will merge the subimages into the destination image and save the resulting image as a new file.

The program will display a message indicating whether the file was saved successfully.
